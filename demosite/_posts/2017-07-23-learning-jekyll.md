Some of the benefits of the learning jekyll static site

- **Simple** - makes building and manitaining websites incredibly simple, Static sites are easier to maintain (No databases, No server-side script). Use static website generations when you're after simiplicity and want to put the emphasis on the content, which is what you should be doing. 

- **First** - Static files can be served fast. 

- **Secure**, as they do not contain dynamic content, so are immune to the most common attacks.

- **Have versioning** - Storing content in flat, text files, makes them ideal to be used with version control systems, such as Git.
